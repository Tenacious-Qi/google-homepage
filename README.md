This project will recreate the Google homepage.

Doing this project was a good exercise in practicing different ways to code navs and footers. The left and right alignment of the nav and footer links on the Google homepage presented a challenge since I didn't have much experience with floats. Ideally, I'd code media queries to fix nav and footer display issues on narrow viewports, but that was not the purpose of this exercise.
